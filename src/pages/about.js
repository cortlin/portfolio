        <h1  className='text-center font-mono text-5xl py-10 mb-4'>About Me</h1>
        <p className='text-gray-900 text-lg'>I have been working as a front-end developer and design for 7 years. I began my career as a wordpress developer for a small marketing agency, building websites for local businesses. I’ve always had an interest in technology, both software and hardware, so I took advantage of working at small companies to learn as many skills as possible. I have experience in marketing, social media advertising, server management, networking, application development, and even Active Directory and exchange management. </p>
        <p className='mt-4 text-gray-900 text-lg'>These days I tend to narrow my focus and stick to web development, building SPA’s using React and Vue, as well as REST and web socket API’s using ExpressJS.</p>
