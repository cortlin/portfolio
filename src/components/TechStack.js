      <p>This site is currently built with vanilla React Javascript framework with static content, and using&nbsp;

      <h3 className="font-bold mt-5">Why React?</h3>
      <p className="mt-5">First and formost, I really like creating websites with React. I feel that is is important to use the tools that I intend to use everyday so I can keep improving my ability to write better javascript.</p>
      <p className="mt-5">As for the second reason, I would like to eventually implement a headless CMS (wordpress) and move all of my content into custom post types to make adding new portfolio items and potentially a blog much more user friendly.</p>
